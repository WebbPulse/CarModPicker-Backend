Backend & Database Development Plan (FastAPI/Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes)

Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

    Project Initialization:
        Set up Python virtual environment (e.g., venv, Poetry).
        Initialize FastAPI project structure.
        Install core dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic.
        Set up basic configuration management (e.g., environment variables, .env file).
    Database Setup:
        Install PostgreSQL driver (psycopg2-binary or asyncpg).
        Choose and install an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like SQLAlchemy (with Alembic for migrations) or Tortoise ORM. Recommended for easier database interaction.
        Define initial database connection logic within FastAPI.
    Initial Dockerization:
        Create a Dockerfile for the FastAPI application.
        Create a basic docker-compose.yml including the FastAPI service and a PostgreSQL service.
        Goal: Ensure the basic FastAPI app can start and connect to the DB via Docker Compose.
    Core Model Definition (Initial):
        Define Pydantic models for API data validation/serialization.
        Define ORM models for core entities: User, Car (start simple: make, model, year, maybe VIN, linked to User).
        Set up database migrations (e.g., Alembic) and create initial migration scripts for these tables. Run migrations.

Phase 2: Authentication & Core CRUD

    User Authentication:
        Implement user registration endpoint (hash passwords!).
        Implement login endpoint (verify password, issue JWT tokens).
        Set up FastAPI dependency/middleware for requiring authentication on protected routes.
    Car CRUD API:
        Develop API endpoints (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for users to manage their Car entities. Ensure endpoints are protected and operate only on the logged-in user's cars.
    Part CRUD API (Initial - User Specific):
        Define Part model (name, brand, category, notes). Recommendation: Start by making Parts belong to a specific User to simplify initial development (avoiding global duplicates/moderation complexity).
        Develop API endpoints for users to manage their own Part entities.
    Testing (Optional but Recommended):
        Write basic unit/integration tests for authentication and CRUD endpoints using pytest and FastAPI's TestClient.

Phase 3: Build List Functionality

    Build List Models:
        Define BuildList model (e.g., name, description, linked to a User and a Car).
        Define a linking table/model (e.g., BuildListItem) to associate Parts with BuildLists (Many-to-Many relationship between BuildList and Part, possibly with extra fields like quantity or notes per item).
        Update migrations.
    Build List Management API:
        Develop API endpoints for users to create, view, update, and delete their BuildLists.
        Develop API endpoints to add/remove Parts from a specific BuildList.
    Sharing Endpoint:
        Develop a specific GET endpoint (e.g., /api/v1/share/lists/{list_id}) that retrieves a specific build list's details (potentially without requiring authentication, depending on your desired sharing mechanism).

Phase 4: Docker Refinement & Initial Deployment (Non-K8s)

    Refine Docker Setup: Optimize Dockerfile (multi-stage builds?), ensure environment variables are handled correctly.
    Robust Docker Compose: Ensure docker-compose.yml includes volumes for persistent PostgreSQL data, handles dependencies correctly, and potentially includes basic health checks.
    (Optional) Simple Cloud Deployment: Deploy the application using Docker Compose on a simple host or using a PaaS (like Render, Fly.io) that supports Docker/Docker Compose to get it running externally. This verifies the containerized setup works.

Phase 5: Kubernetes Deployment (Learning Goal)

    Kubernetes Manifests:
        Write Kubernetes YAML manifests for the backend:
            Deployment: To manage application pods.
            Service: To expose the backend pods internally.
            Secret: To manage sensitive data like DB passwords, JWT secret.
            ConfigMap: For non-sensitive configuration.
        Write Kubernetes YAML manifests for PostgreSQL:
            StatefulSet: Often preferred for databases.
            Service: To expose the database internally.
            PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) & PersistentVolume (PV): To ensure database data persists across pod restarts. (Or use a managed cloud database service).
    Local K8s Deployment:
        Set up a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, Kind, Docker Desktop K8s).
        Deploy the manifests to the local cluster. Debug and ensure connectivity between backend and DB pods.
    (Optional) Ingress:
        Set up an Ingress controller (like Nginx Ingress) in your cluster.
        Create an Ingress resource to expose your backend service externally (initially for API access/testing).
    (Stretch) Cloud K8s Deployment: Deploy manifests to a managed Kubernetes service (GKE, EKS, AKS).
